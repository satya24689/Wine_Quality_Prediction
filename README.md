## About

This GitHub repository contains a wine quality prediction project. We aim to predict the quality of wines based on various features such as acidity, pH levels, and alcohol content. This project uses machine learning techniques to make predictions, and we have achieved a high level of accuracy in our models.

## Features

- Predicts wine quality based on multiple features.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for prediction.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting wine characteristics and obtaining quality predictions.



## Dataset

We used the [Wine Quality Data Set](insert_dataset_link) for training and testing our models. This dataset includes information about various red and white wines, such as acidity levels, residual sugar, and pH values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- pandas
- seaborn
- filterwarnings
- ExtraTreesClassifier

### Installation

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -xgboost 
   ```

## Usage


2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the web interface for wine quality prediction.

[Include any additional usage instructions or examples as needed.]

## Model

We have trained our wine quality prediction model using the following machine learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Used KNN
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Navies Bayes
- Random forest
- Xgboost
